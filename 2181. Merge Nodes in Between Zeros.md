```c

    if(head == NULL) return head;

    struct ListNode* ptr = head;
    struct ListNode* tmp = ptr;

    head = tmp -> next; // Delete the first 0
    ptr = tmp -> next;  // Move to the first num
    free(tmp);  // Free the pointer which previously points to the first 0
    
    while(ptr != NULL){
        while((ptr -> next) ->  val != 0){  // While next's value is not 0, add it to self val and delete the next node
            struct ListNode* tmpNext = ptr -> next;

        ptr -> next = tmp -> next;  // Link the current to the next val that is not 0
        ptr = tmp -> next;  // Move ptr to next val for calculating next round
        free(tmp);  // Delete 0
